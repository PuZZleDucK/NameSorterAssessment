# Helping out

So you want to help develop Open Practice. The simplest way to get started helping Open Practice is in one of the many useful libraries in the ```Libs``` directory.

For example if you wanted to look deeper into the ```NameSort``` library you could start with the contributing.md document in the ```Libs/NameSort``` directory. or check the project wiki on github here: https://github.com/PuZZleDucK/NameSorterAssessment/wiki
