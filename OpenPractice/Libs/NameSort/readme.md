# Name Sorter Library

Assuming you have the Open Practice project setup as described in the main readme.md you will be ready to build and run the name-sorter demo and tests

## Running the sorter demo

```sh
dotnet build
chmod a+x OpenPractice/Demos/name-sorter/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/name-sorter.dll
./OpenPractice/Demos/name-sorter/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/name-sorter.dll <file-to-sort>.txt
```

More advanced developer options for running the project are included in the contributing.md file and on our projects wiki page
